Create forms dynamically

## About
This repository is a form UI developed in Swift. You can create your form by adding questions to it. Currently you can only add multiple choice questions. Toggle the "Required" switch to set whether the question is required to answer. You can also set whether the question allows multiple selection. When answering the form, radio buttons and checkboxes indicate whether the question allows multiple selection and the "Required" label will show if the question is required. When press the "Done" button, your current answers will be saved.

## Test it out
You can build the UI and run on an iOS simulator as is to test it out. First press "Create Form" and add some questions to your form. Then press the "Save" button. The program will check if there are duplicate options or empty options for you. Then press "Show Form" to view your form as an answerer. If you press "Done" and reopen the form, you can see your previous answers have been saved.
